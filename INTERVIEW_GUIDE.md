# Interview Guide

Tips for presenting the projects in this portfolio during interviews:

- Tell a concise story: objective, approach, results, impact.
- Highlight business value: quantify results when possible (e.g., % increase in revenue).
- Discuss trade-offs and assumptions made during analysis.
- Be ready to explain data cleaning steps and why they were necessary.
- Walk through one visualization and explain how it informed a decision.
- For technical roles, be prepared to discuss code choices, performance, and testing.

Example pitch:
"I analyzed 2 years of retail transactions to identify seasonality and top-selling products. After cleaning and aggregating the data, I found Q4 accounts for 40% of annual revenue; optimizing inventory and running targeted promotions during Q4 lifted conversion by 12%.
